💻 Java String Practice Programs – DAY_PRACTICE.java
This project contains beginner-friendly Java string manipulation programs that help practice and understand different String class methods. The code is organized into small programs within the main() method.

📌 Topics Covered
Splitting full name

Uses split(" ") to extract first and last names

Calculates and prints string length

Concatenation

Combines first and last name using both + and .concat()

Substrings using index

Extracts parts of a string using user-defined indices

Demonstrates character access with charAt()-like logic

Conversion using String.valueOf()

Converts integers to string and concatenates for output

Checking for empty or blank strings

Uses isEmpty() and isBlank() for validation and safe input handling

Formatted string output

Uses String.format() to print structured information about a user (name, age, blood group, college, roll number)

📂 File
DAY_PRACTICE.java — main file containing all programs in one main() method

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo or copy the file into your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)

Run the program

Follow input prompts in console

💡 Purpose
This project was created as part of my daily Java revision and hands-on practice plan focused on String manipulation. It combines theoretical concepts with applied coding examples to strengthen understanding.

You can keep updating this file by adding loops, conditionals, or modularizing each program into its own method in future versions.
